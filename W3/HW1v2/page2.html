        <h2>What Is Structured Query Language (SQL)?</h2>
        <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases. It allows users to perform operations like retrieving, updating, deleting, and adding data using structured commands, enabling efficient data management and analysis. SQL is a vital skill for working with structured data stored in databases, which are used by companies across various industries.</p>
        <p> SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.</p>
